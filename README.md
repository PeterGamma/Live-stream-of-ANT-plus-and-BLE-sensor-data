Matlab supports BLE, but I could not find an example of someone confirming that BLE streaming to Matlab is working:

20. There is finally a practical example code available in Matlab for BLE heart rate sensor and BLE foot pod:

https://ch.mathworks.com/help/matlab/import_export/collect-data-from-fitness-monitoring-devices.html

Garmin watches can broadcast sensor data over ANt+, newer Garmin watches can also broadcast sensor data over BLE and should also work with the BLE Matlab example:

No additional toolboxes are necessary for Bluetooth low energy (ble supported in Matlab since 2019b version):
