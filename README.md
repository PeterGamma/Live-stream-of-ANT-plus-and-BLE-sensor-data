10. Garmin watches and BLEv5.0 support?

- There is an example for BLE devices with Heart Rate Profile for Bluetooth Low Energy Specification v5.0, Dec. 06, 2016 in Matlab:

- Garmin HRM Dual™ has ANT+®-Standard (2,4 GHz) and  BLUETOOTH® 5.0 (BLE) support:

- It should be possible to pair the Garmin HRM Dual to a PC with Matlab and connect the sensor to the Matlab example code, but this this needs to be confirmed:
