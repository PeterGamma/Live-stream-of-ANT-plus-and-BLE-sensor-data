Bitalino uses Bluetooth or BLE soft- and hardware, Garmin watches use ANT+ broadcasting and almost only sensors with ANT+ support. There is hardly any ANT+ live streaming desktop applications available, and BLE would also be attractive for android application developement. Why does Garmin not offer a contemporary BLE live-streaming support for their watches and sensors, which can be connected to BLE desktop example code?
